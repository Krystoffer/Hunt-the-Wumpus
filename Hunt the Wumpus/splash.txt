Remember KIng Midas? Yes.. The king that turned into a donkey.
Well, he's now possessed by his greed and an evil spirit which
turned him into a horrible monster that turns everything into
gold.

Decades have passed and now he is known as the "wumpus". The
villagers have posted a wanted poster for the wumpus with a
bounty of $1,000. All right, I know it's not a lot, they're
not rich and that's the best they can give. For those who can
kill the wumpus, they are also allowed to take back everything
that is inside the wumpus' hideout.

You as a bounty hunter, are tempted by the reward and found out
that the wumpus lives in a certain cave not far from your guild.
Will you take up the offer to kill the wumpus?

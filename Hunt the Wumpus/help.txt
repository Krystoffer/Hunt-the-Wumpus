=================================HELP===============================

In this game, you are a bounty hunter who went on a quest to kill the
wumpus. During your exploration of the wumpus's hideout, you will find
traps and items.

TRAPS
========================
PIT	If you have a grappling hook, you will automatically use it
	and you will be saved however, the grappling hook will wear
	out and not fit for further use as it is already old. Otherwise,
	you are as good as a water droplet

BAT	If you have a bat whistle, the bat will not bother you however,
	they will snatch it away so that you can't blow it anymore.
	Otherwise, you will be sent to a random room and it is possible
	to be dropped at a pit or the wumpus.

WUMPUS	It will start of sleeping at a random place in the cavern. You
	need to shoot it in order to kill it. If you miss your shot, it
	will wake up but if you have a silencer, you will need at least
	2 missed shots to wake the wumpus up. If you meet with the wumpus,
	you will be turned into a golden statue and lose.

	Upon waking up, the wumpus will move to another room 3 out of 4
	times and go back to sleep 1 out of 4 times.


ITEMS
=========================
BATTERIES	The cavern is dark and therefore you use a pair of night
		vision goggles, but you forgot to bring spare batteries.
		Any batteries you find in the cave can be used to recharge
		your goggles.

AMMO		The bullets found in the cavern are coincidentally the
		same caliber as the one you use.

SILENCER	An attachment to your pistol do reduce the noise produced
		when shooting, thus not causing the wumpus to instantly
		wake up from the noise.

GRAPPLING HOOK	It will save you from falling into a pit once

BAT WHISTLE	It will save you from being transported by the bats once
